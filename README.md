 # üè• Hospital Readmission Risk Analysis

Analysed 100,000+ patient records from the UCI Hospital Readmission dataset using **MySQL** to uncover risk patterns in early hospital readmissions. The project aims to identify high-risk groups, optimize treatment plans, and reduce hospital inefficiencies: through SQL queries.

---

## Objectives

- Identify departments and diagnoses with high readmission rates
- Analyze age groups and medication counts linked to readmission risk
- Provide data-driven insights to improve patient care and reduce costs
- Showcase advanced SQL querying with real healthcare data

## Business Questions Answered

- Which hospital departments have the highest readmission rates?
- Which age groups are most vulnerable to early readmission?
- What diagnoses are linked with long hospital stays?
- How does insulin treatment impact readmission?
- Do patients on more medications face higher readmission risks?
